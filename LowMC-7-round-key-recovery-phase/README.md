This code is used to verify equations degree of LowMC-5-round-key-recovery-phase

In this code, we set secret key a vector with all bits are 1 and check whether equations are correct by substituting the values of the key into the equations.

All equations are saved to a file, and you can modify the file path according to your specific situation.

You can check that degree of all the equations is 3, which is consistent with the description in our paper."
