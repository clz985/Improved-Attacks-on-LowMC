The code is used to verify the success probability and cubic equation system of our on full LowMC with 2 chosen plaintexts.

The code can be compiled using the command: g++ LowMC.cpp LowMC.h main.cpp -03 -std=c++11

Then, when running the code, you are required to input a command (1 or 2) to perform experiments on different constructions.

1 -> test the success probability with a full S-box layer (800 tests in a few minutes)

2 -> construct the cubic equation system
